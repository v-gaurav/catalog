## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(220, 60%, 50%) - RGB(51, 102, 204). A professional and trustworthy blue, not a cliche, and useful for creating a dependable impression.
- Background color: HSL(220, 20%, 95%) - RGB(242, 242, 247). A light, desaturated background that is easy on the eyes and gives the content prominence.

- Use a consistent style of outlined icons throughout the interface, ensuring clarity and ease of recognition.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout for the catalog listings, facilitating easy scanning and comparison of tools.
